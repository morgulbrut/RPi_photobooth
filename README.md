RPi_photobooth
==============

These files are supplied as part of an [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-photo-booth-controller/) that describes how to build a photobooth using a Raspberry Pi as the "brains" of a camera, printer, and user interface controller.

added by me:

1. A simple webserver to get the pictures
2. A simple static website generated by a shell script 
3. Removed the print because reasons
4. Rotate the image to portrait
